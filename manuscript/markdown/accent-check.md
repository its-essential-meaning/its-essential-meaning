## Emphasis and Pali

"The Tathāgata, monks, is Arahat, is All Enlightened. Give ear, monks.
Deathlessness has been reached (*amatamadhigataṁ*). I will intruct you."
*Amatamadhigataṁ* means "__gone__ to deathlessness" and __not__ "going to
deathlessness." It is something that __has happened__ or __has been
achieved__ "Having attained it and realised it" (*sacchikatvā
upasampajja*) the Arahat "lives experiencing it in the body" (*kāyena ca
phusitvā viharati*).
