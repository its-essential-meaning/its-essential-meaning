# All Things Are Not Self

The Buddha shows that a thing is impermanent by showing that the
necessary condition (or the *saṅkhāra*) upon which the thing depends
is impermanent.

This can be seen, for instance, in the *Pārileyya Sutta*.[^parileyya]
The destruction of the cankers is spoken of, and the following passage
occurs:

> "Monks, how knowing, how seeing, is there without delay the
> destruction of the cankers? Here, monks, the uninstructed
> *puthujjana* not discerning the Noble Ones, unskilled in the Noble
> Doctrine, untrained in the Noble Doctrine, not disceming the Worthy
> Ones, not skilled in the Doctrine of the Worthy Ones, regards Form
> as 'self'.  This regarding, monks, is the *saṅkhāra*. This
> *saṅkhāra*, how does it result, how does it arise, how is it born,
> and how is it produced? In the uninstructed *puthujjana*, monks,
> nourished by feeling that is born from Contact with Ignorance,
> arises *taṅhā*. Thence is born that *saṅkhāra*.  Thus, monks, that
> *saṅkhāra* is impermanent, determined, dependently arisen. That
> *taṅhā* is impermanent, determined, dependently arisen. That Contact
> is impermanent, is determined, is dependently arisen. That Ignorance
> is impermanent, is determined, is dependently arisen. Thus knowing,
> monks, thus seeing, is there without delay the destruction of the
> cankers."

And so with the other Groups, Feeling, Perception, Determinations
and Consciousness.

[^parileyya]: Saṃyutta Nikāya III, Khandha Saṃyutta, Khajjaniya Vagga, Sutta No. 9.

Here, the cankers are the things (*dhammā*) considered. The necessary
condition for the cankers is the regarding of Form (or the other
Groups) as 'self'. That is, regarding the Groups as 'self' is the
*saṅkhāra* for the cankers. Thus we have: "This regarding, monks, is
the *saṅkhāra*." The Buddha then goes on to show that the *saṅkhāra*
on which the cankers depend is impermanent by showing that this
*saṅkhāra* in turn depends upon certain other conditions for its own
existence. So we have, "Thus, monks, that *saṅkhāra* impermanent, is
determined, dependently arisen." When the impermanence of the
*saṅkhāra* called "regarding the groups as 'self'" is seen, then the
impermanence of the cankers which depend on this *saṅkhāra* is seen,
and hence the possibility of their destruction is seen.

In the above, the Buddha does not directly say that the cankers are
impermanent. He indicates the fact in an indirect manner. He shows
that the cankers are impermanent by showing that the *saṅkhāra* which
forms the necessary condition for the cankers to exist is impermanent.
I will stop regarding the house I live in as permanent only if I see
that the constituents which form the necessary conditions for the
house, i.e. the foundation, the walls, the roof, etc., are
impermanent. My being merely told that the house is impermanent does
not convince me of its impermanence.  That the house is impermanent is
seen by me only by my seeing that its constituent factors are
impermanent. When the constituent factors that go to make up the house
are impermanent then the house must necessaiily be impermanent:
"Whatever cause, whatever condition there be for the arising of
Form ... Feeling ... Perception ... Determinations ...
Consciousness, that is impermanent. How can, monks, consciousness that
is so composed of impermanent things be permanent?"[^cause] With
regard to the other two characteristics of the Grasping Groups, viz.,
Not-self and Suffering, the same applies.  When the *saṅkhāra* are
Not-self and Suffering those things determined by the *saṅkhāra* are
also Not-self and Suffering.

[^cause]: Saṃyutta Nikāya III, Khandha Saṃyutta, Anicca Vagga, Sutta No. 7.

The Buddha shows the *puthujjana* that whatever thing (*dhamma*) he
identities as 'self' is something that is dependent upon other things.
In other words, he shows the *puthujjana* that the latter's 'self' is
a determined thing dependent upon determinations, upon *saṅkhāra*.
He further shows that these *saṅkhāra* which form the necessary
conditions for that thing identified as 'self' are impermanent. "All
*sañkhāra* are impermanent (*sabbe saṅkhāra aniccā*)".[^anicca]

[^anicca]: Majjhima Nikāya 35.

Now, when he sees that the *saṅkhāra* upon which his 'self' depends
are impermanent, then he sees that this his 'self' must also be
necessarily impermanent, and hence not worth holding to.  That means
he is now left with a 'self' that is impermanent and not worth holding
to. (He finds that he has no real mastery in the face of this
impermanence.) And if it is impermanent and not worth holding to, then
it contradicts the very concept of 'self'.  This means that what he
had identified as 'self' is now no longer self. The thing (*dhamma*)
which he had regarded as 'self', he now finds is Not-self (*anattā*).
Thus: "All things are Not-Self" (*sabbe dhammā anattā*).

Therefore, when "All *saṅkhāra* are impermanent" is seen "All things
are Not-self" and "All *saṅkhāra* are Suffering"[^see] are also seen.
These three stand together, and fall together. When there is
perception of Impermanence there is simultaneously perception of
Not-self and perception of Suffering. When perception of Impermanence
is not there, there is also no perception of Not-self and no
perception of Suffering.
