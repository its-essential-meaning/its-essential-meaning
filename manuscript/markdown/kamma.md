# Kamma

It is useful to discuss briefly the subject of intentional action once
again.

> “Intention, monks, I declare is *kamma*. Having intended, one does
> *kamma* through body, speech, and mind.”[^1]

This statement of the Buddha is not quite as simple as it is usually
reckoned to be. Firstly, from the *Sutta* (Discourse) itself, it is
clear that this statement was made in relation to the *non*-Arahat.
The literal meaning of *kamma* is ‘action’. With the *puthujjana* it
therefore refers to ‘*my* action’ or ‘*I* act’. The word *kamma* is
used in this sense. Further expanded, *kamma* means ‘*my* intentional
action’ or ‘the action *I* intentionally take’. And *all* action that
is consciously done is intentional. This intentional action can be by
means of body, speech, or mind.

Intentional action *unaccompanied* by thoughts of ‘I’ or ‘mine’ is
*not kamma*. The Arahat has no thoughts of ‘I’ and ‘mine’. Therefore
the Arahat’s intentional action is not *kamma*. The Arahat has
intentional action, but no *kamma*. *Kamma is the non-Arahat’s
intentional action*. Of the Arahat the Buddha says: “He does not
commit new *kamma*.”[^2]

Ethics is concerned with the question of ‘what should *I* do’. Whether
that ‘what should be done by *me*’ is good or bad, moral or immoral,
etc., it is necessarily something which *I* should do.

Ethics accepts that ‘I’ and ‘mine’ must exist. It builds itself on the
basis that ‘I’ is a necessity. Ethics may or may not be conscious of
its own position here. Nevertheless that remains its basic position.
Actually, ethics is a searching after the most comfortable or the best
way in which ‘I’ can exist. But, as we shall see later on, ‘I’ exists
only in so far as Ignorance of the Four Noble Truths exists. Ethics
does not know this fact. Thus, in the final analysis, ethics is a
searching after the most comfortable and best way in which Ignorance
can exist. It is therefore no wonder that no two schools of ethics are
in agreement.  Wherever there is Ignorance, there is conflict.

Where ‘I’ and ‘mine’ are wholly and entirely extinct, there the
question of what should *I* do does not arise. Arahatship is *the
extinction of ethics also*. Whilst all religions, in the end, teach an
ethics of some kind or other. Buddha teaches the extinction of *all*
ethics also.

The Buddha teaches the arising and ceasing of *kamma* thus:

> "Monks, were there *kamma* performed in lust, born of lust,
> conditioned by lust, arising from lust – that *kamma* is unskilful
> (*akusala*), that *kamma* is blameworthy, that *kamma* has pain as
> fruit, that *kamma* leads to the arising of (further) *kamma*. That
> *kamma* does not lead to the cessation of *kamma*. Monks, were
> there *kamma* performed in hatred … performed in delusion … that
> *kamma* is unskilful, that *kamma* is blameworthy, that *kamma* has
> pain as fruit, that *kamma* leads to the arising of *kamma*. That
> *kamma* does not lead to the ceasing of *kamma*. These, monks, are
> the three conditions for the arising of *kamma*.
>
> “Monks, were there *kamma* performed with non-lust, conditioned by
> non-lust, arising from non-lust – that *kamma* is skilful
> (*kusala*), that *kamma* is praiseworthy, that *kamma* has happiness
> as fruit, that *kamma* leads to the ceasing of *kamma*. That *kamma*
> does not lead to the arising of *kamma*. Monks, were there *kamma*
> performed with non-hatred … performed with non-delusion … that
> *kamma* is skilful, that *kamma* is praiseworthy, that *kamma* has
> happiness as fruit, that *kamma* leads to the ceasing of *kamma*.
> That *kamma* does not lead to the arising of *kamma*. These, monks,
> are the three conditions for the ceasing of *kamma*.”[^3]

Summarized, the above means: unskilful *kamma* leads to the arising
of *kamma*, and skilful *kamma* leads to the cessation of *kamma*. Or,
unskilful intentional action accompanied by thoughts of ‘I’ and ‘mine’
leads to further intentional action accompanied by thoughts of ‘I’ and
‘mine’, and skilful intentional action accompanied by thoughts of ‘I’
and ‘mine’ leads to the cessation of intentional action accompanied by
thoughts of ‘I’ and ‘mine’. The Arahat not having any thoughts of ‘I’
and ‘mine’ whatsoever does *not* perform *either* skilful *or*
unskilful *kamma*.

The Buddha further teaches how *kamma* rooted in lust, hatred and
delusion leads to further *kamma* whilst *kamma* rooted in non-lust,
non-hatred and non-delusion leads to the cessation of *kamma*, thus:

> "Monks, there are these three conditions for the arising of
> *kamma*.  What three? Monks, for things which in the past were based
> on desire and attachment … in the future will be based on desire and
> attachment … in the present are based on desire and attachment,
> desire is born.
>
> “How, monks, is desire born for things which in the past were based
> on desire and attachment … in the future will be based on desire and
> attachment … in the present are based on desire and attachment?
> Monks, things which in the past … in the future … in the present are
> based on desire and attachment, one turns over in his mind. Thus
> turning over in his mind things which in the present are based on
> desire, desire is born. Desire being born, he is fettered by those
> things. I call it a fetter, monks – that mind full of attachment.
> Thus, monks, is desire born for things which in the present are
> based on desire and attachment.  These are the three conditions,
> monks, for the arising of *kamma*.”

On the other hand: "How, monks, is desire not born for things which in
the past were based on desire and attachment … in the future will be
based on desire and attachment … in the present are based on desire
and attachment? Monks, one understands the future result of things
which in the present are based on desire. Seeing this result one turns
away from them. Turning away from them, the mind getting detached from
them, one penetrates them with wisdom and sees them plain. Thus,
monks, is desire not born for those things which in the present are
based on desire.’’[^4]

[^2]: Of all the many things about *kamma* the Buddha has taught, such as the various types of *kamma* and their various fruits (*vipāka*), this is the most important. It is also the most fundamental thing about it.
