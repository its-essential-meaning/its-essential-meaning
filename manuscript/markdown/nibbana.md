# Nibbāna

By now the reader may have obtained some idea of the individual called
the Arahat. Essentially, the Arahat is that individual who has no
notions whatever of 'self', and no thoughts whatever of 'I' and
'mine'. Thus he is not subject to any form of Suffering whatever. In
other words, we may say that in the Arahat these things are extinct.
Or, the Arahat is that individual who experiences here and now the
__extinction__ of these things. In him these can __never__ arise
again. He __experiences__ extinction. That is, he experiences *Nibbāna*.

*Nibbāna* literally means extinction (or cessation). The word by
itself says nothing more. To the question "The extinction of what, is
*Nibbāna*?" many answers can be given. Some of the more important
answers would be that it is the extinction of subjectivity, or of
Suffering, or of the cankers, or of *tanhā*, or of Grasping. The
extinction of any one of these things implies __also__ the extinction
of the others. When all subjectivity is extinct, all Suffering is also
extinct, Ignorance is also extinct, the cankers are also extinct, and
so on. It is therefore clear that *Nibbāna* can be described in many
ways, and in discussion one would usually refer to it as the
extinction of that thing round which the discussion revolves. If one
is discussing *bhava*, then it would be appropriate to describe
*Nibbāna* as the extinction or cessation of *bhava*: "The cessation
of *bhava* is *Nibbāna*"[^extinct] -- *bhavanirodho nibbānaṃ*. If one
is discussing the 'person' (*sakkāya*) then it would be appropriate to
say that Nibbīzna is the cessation of the 'person'
(*sakkāyanirodho*).[^sakkaya] If we reckon the purpose of the Buddha's
Teaching (which should at no time be lost sight of) then we will
describe *Nibbāna* as the extinction of Suffering, or as the cessation
of Suffering, or as the destruction of Suffering.

[^extinct]: Anguttara Nikāya V. Dasaka Nipāta, Ānisaṃsa Vagga, Sutta No. 7.

[^sakkaya]: Saṃyutta Nikāya III, Khandha Saṃyutta, Anta Vagga, Sutta No. 3.

*Nibbāna* is often defined as "the destruction of lust, the
destruction of hatred, and the destruction of delusion."[^destruct]

[^destruct]: Saṃyutta Nikāya IV. Jambukhādaka Saṃyutta, Sutta No. 1.

We saw earlier that Arahatship also has been defined by the Buddha as
"the destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, and the
destruction of delusion." It means that the Arahat experiences all
this destructions. He experiences the extinction of lust, hatred and
delusion. Thus he experiences *Nibbāna*.

In the Saṁyutta Nikāya IV, there are 33 descriptive words
given for the Not-*Determined* (*asaṅkhata*) or for the destruction of
lust, hatred and delusion. As terms for the destruction of lust,
hatred and delusion, they also become terms for Arahatship, and
so for *Nibbāna* as well. In fact one term is *Nibbāna* itself. It is
well worth rapidly going through these terms dwelling at some
length on the more important ones.

#### (1) Asaṅkhata - The *Not*-Determined

We have seen its meaning earlier. It means Not-*Determined*.
There is no 'person' or subject ('I') determined. To the Arahat
*only* is applicable the word 'impersonal' in its *fullest* meaning.

#### (2) Antaṁ - The End

Arahatship is the *summum bonum* of all life's endeavour. It
is the end. All that had to be done has been done (*kataṃ karanīyaṁ*).
There is nothing more to come here from (*nāparaṁ
itthattāyāti*). "For the Arahat, friend, there is nothing further to be
done."[^sutta10]

[^sutta10]: Saṃyutta Nikāya III, Khandha Saṃyutta, Dhammakathika Vagga, Sutta No.10.

#### (3) Anāsavaṁ - The Without Cankers

All the Cankers, viz., the cankers of sense-pleasure, of
'self'-existence, and of Ignorance are extinct in Arahatship.

#### (4) Saccaṁ - The Truth

The experience of Arahatship is the experience of the highest
truth, or of the highest actuality. "For this, monks, is the highest
Ariyan wisdom, that is to say the knowledge of the destruction of
all Suffering. That deliverance of his is founded on truth, is
unshakeable... For this, monks, is the highest Ariyan truth, that
is to say, *Nibbāna*, which is not a state unreal."[^saccam]

[^saccam]: Majjhima Nikāya 140.

#### (5) Pāraṁ - The Beyond

Essentially it means that Arahatship is beyond all Suffering.

#### (6) Nipunaṁ - The Subtle

The experience of the Arahat is not plain to common
understanding. It is deep, and cannot be comprehended through a
process of mere conceptual thinking. It is comprehensible only to
the wise man, and that too if he dwells upon it with Right
Mindfulness (*sammā sati*).

*Nipunaṁ* can also be taken to mean "accomplished" or
"skilled".

#### (7) Saduddasaṁ - The Very Hard to See

What is so very hard to see is that the Arahat has intention
but has no thoughts of subjectivity, or that he has intention but
no *tanhā*. His intentional action is completely unaccompanied by
any thoughts of 'I" and 'mine'.

#### (8) Ajaraṁ - The No-decay

We have already seen its meaning. The Arahat does not decay
simply because there is no 'person' or 'I" to decay. The changes
that occur in his body are not decay to him.

#### (9) Dhuvaṁ - The Stable

Arahatship is *the* stable simply because it is *the only* state of
life that *does not* and *cannot* change its character or nature. For
instance, the Arahat can never go back to being a *puthujjana*.
Arahatship is irreversible.[^irreversible]

[^irreversible]: It will be seen that the Buddha's Teaching is aimed at altering one's thinking, and altering it to the point where it can *never more* be altered.

#### (10) Apalokitaṁ - The Taken Leave of

The Arahat has "taken leave of" the world. "*My* world" is
extinct in him. So long as he lives he experiences feelings, etc.,
but he is neither attracted by them nor repelled by them.

#### (11) Anidassanaṁ - The Non-Indicative

This is one of the most important descriptions of
Arahatship, yet one which is often misunderstood. *Anidassanaṁ*
is usually seen explained as "invisible" or "cannot be seen with
the eyes". Far from such, *anidassanaṁ* refers to something very
important and equally difficult to see.

Literally, *anidassanaṁ* means "not pointing to" or
"non-indicative". What, however, does Arahatship not point to? Of
what is it non-indicative?

The answer is: a subject ('I').

The non-Arahat has Grasping Consciousness. That is to say,
to the non-Arahat, in varying degrees, things present themselves
as 'mine'. And as we have said earlier this presence of things as
'mine' points to an 'I' to whom they are present. A subject 'I'
is thus indicated. With the Arahat there is no presence of things
as 'mine'. His Consciousness is Not-Grasping (*anupādā*). No
'mine' being present, no 'I' is indicated. The Arahat's
Consciousness therefore does not point to or indicate a subject
'I'. Thus his Consciousness is non-indicative (*viññāṇaṁ
anidassanaṁ*). That is why Arahatship is described as the
"Non-Indicative".

To the non-Arahat in varying degrees "things are mine". To
the Arahat, "things are". When the life of the Arahat ceases
"things are" also ceases. In other words: To the non-Arahat there
is a 'my world'; to the Arahat 'my world' has ceased, and there is
only a 'world' left; when the Arahat's life ceases the 'world' also
ceases.

#### (12) Nippapaṁ - The Without Impediment

'I am' is called a *papañcitaṁ*.[^papancitam] 'I am' is also called a
*maññitaṁ* (supposition), a *mānagataṁ* (gone to conceit).[^managatam]
*Papañca* is sometimes taken to refer to "diffuseness in thinking".[^diffuseness]
From this it is clear that *papañca* refers definitely to something
that is a hindrance or impediment to progress. The Arahat has cut
out all such impediments (*chinnapapañca*). Arahatship is therefore
without impediment.

[^papancitam]: Saṃyutta Nikāya IV, Saḷāyatana Saṃyutta, Āsīvisa Vagga, Sutta No. 11.

[^managatam]: Saṃyutta Nikāya IV, Saḷāyatana Saṃyutta, Āsīvisa Vagga, Sutta No. 11.

[^diffuseness]: Anguttara Nikāya IV, Aṭṭhaka Nipāta, Gahapati Vagga, Sutta No. 10.

#### (l3) Santaṁ - The Peace

In the *puthujjana* there is no real peace, no real tranquility.
So long as thoughts of 'I' and 'mine' are present there *cannot* be
utter peace. These being absent in the Arahat he is really and truly
at peace. Arahatship is the highest peace it is possible to
experience.

#### (14) Amataṁ - The Deathless

We have seen earlier what is meant by the Arahat being
deathless. With the Arahat there is no 'person' to die.

#### (15) Panītaṁ - The Excellent

Arahatship is the most excellent experience possible.

#### (16) Sivaṁ - The Fortunate

Arahatship is the most fortunate purely because there is no
Suffering whatsoever.

#### (17) Khemaṁ - The Security

Arahatship is the experiencing of the highest security. It is
the highest form of security because there is no 'person' or 'I' to
feel any insecurity. The 'person' not existing, the experience is
one that is completely free from insecurity.

#### (18) Tanhakkhayo - The Desttuction of tanhā

The Arahat is free from all *tanhā*, of whatever kind it be.

#### (19) Acchariyaṁ - The Wonderful

Arahatship is the truly wonderful experience.

#### (20) Abbhūtaṁ - The Astonishing

Arahatship is the truly astonishing experience.

#### (21)Anītikaṁ - The Freedom from Harm

With the Arahat there is no 'person' to be harmed. A painful
feeling is experienced just in the same unattached or unaffected
manner as a pleasant feeling would be.

#### (22) Anītikadhammaṁ - The State of Freedom from Harm

Arahatship is an experience that is beyond being harmed. It is
the state of freedom from harm.

#### (23) Nibbānaṁ - Extinction

This is a word with a very broad meaning, and in its meaning
it includes the extinction of all those that make for the *Grasping*
Groups. As we shall presently see it is extended to cover the
extinction of the residual Not-Grasping Groups which happens
when the life of the Arahat comes to an end.

#### (24) Avyāpajjho - The Harmless

In Arahatship there is no ill-will, no thoughts of causing
harm, etc., whatever.

#### (25) Virāgo - Non-Attachment

Arahatship is described as non-attachment purely because
there is no attachment of any kind whatever to things. With
non-attachment there also comes the corresponding characteristic of
non-resistance or non-repulsion. The Arahat is neither attracted by
things nor repelled by them.

#### (26) Suddhi - Purity

In the true and worthy sense of the word, it is only
Arahatship that can be called Purity.

#### (27) Mutti- The Release

Arahatship is the release from all Suffering.

#### (28) Anālayo - The Done Away With

Usually in the context of done away with *tanhā*. The Arahat
has completely done away with *tanhā* or any other thing that
makes for Suffering.

#### (29) Dīpaṁ - The Island

Used in a metaphorical sense for safety - safety from all
Suffering. Arahatship is the island of safety.

#### (3O) Lena - The Cave

Again used in a metaphorical sense. Arahatship is compared
to a cave which one gets into for safety from all harm, etc.

#### (3l) Tānaṁ - The Shelter

Once again used in a metaphorical sense. Arahatship is the
shelter from all harm, etc.

#### (32) Saranaṁ - The Refuge

Arahatship is the only refuge from all Suffering. It is so
because it is only the Arahat who is completely free from all
Suffering.

#### (33) Parāyanaṁ - The Ultimate Goal

A goal beyond Arahatship there is not. All other 'goals' are
nothing but various states involving Suffering to *some* degree or
other. Arahatship is wholly and entirely free from Suffering.
Hence it is the ultimate goal.

## note: four asterisk mark: hierarchy to be solved.

Apart from the above thirty three descriptions other
descriptions for Arahatship are to be found, such as not-born
(*ajātaṁ*), not-being (*abhūtaṁ*) or not-made (*akataṁ*): "Monks,
there is the not-born, the not-being, the not-made, and the not-*determined*.
If, monks, there were not the not-born, the not-being,
the not-made and the not-*determined*, there would be discerned no
escape here from the born, the being, the made and the
*determined*. But, monks, since there is the not-born, the not-being,
the not-made and the not-determined, therefore an escape
from the born, the being, the made, and the *determined* is
discernible."[^not-born] *Arahatship is referred to as not-born, not-being,
not-made and not-determined because with regard to the Arahat there is
no longer a 'person' (who says "I' and 'mine') that is born or
being or made or determined.*

[^not-born]: Udāna, Pāṭaligāmiya Vagga, Sutta No. 3.

Another common description of Arahatship is the "ultimate
happiness" (*paramaṁ sukhaṁ*). This "ultimate happiness" is
defined by the Buddha as follows: "Were there a going beyond the
sense-pleasures of the world, that detachment is happiness. Were
there a destruction of the conceit 'I am', that indeed is the
ultimate happiness."[^ultimatehappiness]

[^ultimatehappiness]: Mahāvagga I, Mucalinda Kathā.

A description of Arahatship which would interest the ethicist
is that given in the *Pāsādika Sutta*[^ethicist] wherein the Buddha in
describing the Arahat says: "Friend, the monk in whom the
cankers are destroyed is incapable of deliberately depriving a
living being of life. The monk in whom the cankers are destroyed
is incapable of taking what is not given so that it constitutes
theft. The monk in whom the cankers are destroyed is incapable
of indulging in sex (*methunaṁ dhammaṁ*). The monk is whom
the cankers are destroyed is incapable of mindfully uttering
falsehood. The monk in whom the cankers are destroyed is
incapable of laying up treasure for indulging in pleasures as he did
when being a house-holder. The monk in whom the cankers are
destroyed is incapable of taking a course of action through desire.
The monk in whom the cankers are destroyed is incapable of
taking a course of action through hatred. The monk in whom the
cankers are destroyed is incapable of taking a course of action
through delusion. The monk in whom the cankers are destroyed is
incapable of taking a course of action through fear. Friend, the
monk who is Arahat, in whom the cankers are destroyed, has done
what was to be done, has laid down the burden, attained the
highest, completely destroyed the fetter of *bhava*, released through
right knowledge, is incapable of these nine behaviours."

[^ethicist]: Dīgha Nikāya 29.

The Arahat is incapable (*abhabbo*) of doing these nine things.
The nature of Arahatship is such that it is *impossible* for these
things to be done. The conditions that must be present if these
things are to be done are not present in the Arahat, nor can they
ever arise in him again.

Of all these descriptions of Arahatship the most common
one, however, is that it is the destruction of lust, hatred and
delusion.

Now, Arahatship as we saw, is the experience of the
extinction of Grasping. The Five Grasping Groups are wholly and
entirely extinct and what remains is a Not-Grasping residual Five
Groups. These residual Five Groups are called the "Extinction
element with residue" (*saupādisesa nibbānadhātu*). It is the "stuff
remaining". When Arahatship is over, i.e., when the life of the
Arahat is over, the "residue" is also over. This is called
"Extinction element without residue". (*anupādisesa nibbānadhātu*).
It is "without stuff remaining". In the three phases we have,
therefore, firstly Five Grasping Groups, secondly Five Groups,
and thirdly the extinction of the Five Groups. The first refers to
the non-Arahat, the second to the Arahat, and the third to the
life-ending of the Arahat.

> "Monks, there are these two *Nibbāna* elements. What two? .
> The *Nibbāna* element with residue and the *Nibbāna* element
> without residue.
>
> "What, monks, is the *Nibbāna* element with residue?

> "Here, monks, a monk is Arahat, has destroyed the cankers,

> Nibbāna element without residue."[^residue]

[^residue]: Itivuttaka 44.

Often it is assumed that the descriptions of *Nibbāna* such as
not-born, not-being, not-made and not-*determined* are descriptions
of the *Nibbāna* element without residue. This is a wrong
assumption. Making such a wrong assumption, it is lamented
that the Nibbāna element without residue is an
incomprehensibility. But such a situation should not arise.

There is nothing incomprehensible in the Buddha's Teaching,
though the Teaching is certainly difficult to *see*. The
Not-*Determined* (*asañkhata*) has been very clearly defined as
Arahatship. And any synonym for Not-*Determined* must also be a
descriptive word for Arahatship or for the *Nibbāna* element with
residue.

Another *Sutta* passage which describes the *Nibbāna* element
with residue, but is usually taken to describe the *Nibbāna* element
without residue, is as follows: "Monks, there is that sphere
wherein is neither earth nor water nor fire nor air, wherein is
neither the sphere of infinite space, nor of infinite consciousness,
nor of nothingness, nor of neither-perception-nor-non-perception,
wherein is neither this world nor a world beyond, nor both sun
and moon. There, monks, there is no coming, I declare; no going,
no persisting,[^persisting] no passing away, no arising. Without support
without being, without anything as object it is. This, indeed, is
the end of Suffering."[^sutta1]

[^persisting]: As shown earlier, *thitiṃ* (persistence) is a characteristic of the *saṅkhata*, i.e. of the Five Grasping Groups. It is not a characteristic of the *asaṅkhata* which is Arahatship. Appearance (*uppādo*), disappearance (*vayo*), and *thitiṃ* (persistence) are applicable only to a 'person' or a 'self' or a 'somebody'. With the Arahat the latter are extinct; hence appearance, disappearance, and persistence are not applicable.

[^sutta1]: Udāna, Pāṭaligāmiya Vagga, Sutta No. 1.

Here again it is Arahatship or the *Nibbāna* element *with*
residue that is being referred to. To get the full meaning of this
passage, however, one must understand what is meant by the
Four Primary Modes - earth, water, fire and air - "getting no
footing".

In the *Kevaḍḍha Sutta*[^Kevaddha] we have Kevaḍḍha asking the
question: "Where do the Four Primary Modes - earth, water, fire
and air - cease without remainder?"

[^Kevaddha]: Dīgha Nikāya 11.

The Buddha points out to Kevaḍḍha that it is not a proper
question, and that the proper question should be: "Where do (the
Modes) earth, water, fire and air get no footing (*nagādhati*)?
Where do long and short, large and small, auspicious and
inauspicious, and Name-and-Form cease without remainder
(*asesaṁ uparujjhati*)?"

It is necessary to see why Kevaḍḍha's question is not a proper
question before we can see the significance of the question that
the Buddha himself put in its place.

The Four Primary Modes (i.e. the four primary modes of
behaviour) *purely by themselves* are not a matter for
Consciousness. But their *appearance* is a matter for
Consciousness, and their 'existence' is *inferred* through the
behaviour of this *appearance*, i.e. through the behaviour of Name
(*nāma*). In other words, since Name behaves in a certain fashion
(e.g. while an object is perceived the percept behaves in a certain
fashion) we *infer* that the object, or that the set of behaviours, of
which we are conscious behaves in that same fashion too. This
means that we are really *inferring* that the Four Primary Modes
exist. Therefore, strictly speaking, we cannot say that the Four
Primary Modes *exist*. At the same time, since there is a
behaviour of appearance we cannot also say that they do *not* exist.
Further, if we cannot say that they *exist*, we cannot also say that
they *cease*. Thus Kevaḍḍha's question is improper.[^improper]

[^improper]: The impropriety of Kevaḍḍha's question is fully within the scope of Science and the Philosophy of Science. But the same does not apply to the question that the Buddha put in its place and to its answer, the reason being that Arahatship is beyond the scope of any Science or Philosophy.

What we *can* rightly say is that there is a behaviour of
appearance - a behaviour which is not motivated by the
individual's Consciousness but by something which he
experiences as having *no* connection with his Consciousness. The
appearance keeps behaving as he maintains his awareness. What
*does* definitely exist for the individual is his being conscious of
something and the appearance of that something whilst he is so
conscious. Thus the Four Primary Modes get a *footing* in this
existence. And it gets this footing as the *behaviour of appearance*.
In other words, we can only say that the Four Primary Modes
*appear to exist as rūpa* (i.e. as Form or 'matter') in *nāma-rūpa*
(Name-and-Form).[^Form] Appearance gets a borrowed behaviour and
behaviour gets a borrowed appearance.

[^Form]: The Buddha states that Form or 'matter' is dependent on the Four Primary Modes. See page 20. This statement is better understood at this stage.

As against what is the case with the Four Primary Modes
the concepts of long and Short, large and small, auspicious and
inauspicious are *always* a matter for Consciousness. They are
actually a part of Name, and therefore exist for so long as
Consciousness exists only.

Now, for Name-and-Form to be there, Consciousness must
be there. When Consciousness ceases, Name-and-Form ceases.
When Name-and-Form ceases, the Four Primary Modes *lose their
footing in existence*, and those concepts like long and short, large
and small, auspicious and inauspicious *cease*. Therefore
Kevaḍḍha's question should be as formulated by the Buddha.

Further, we have seen that cessation has two aspects, firstly
the cessation of the Grasping, and secondly the cessation of the
Not-Grasping Residue. In the same manner "getting a footing"
also has two aspects.

With the Arahat, Grasping Consciousness has ceased. The
Arahat's Consciousness is Not-Grasping (*anupādā*). That means,
nothing is present to him as 'mine'. Now, 'mine' being absent, no
'I' is indicated (*anidassanaṁ*). No 'I' being present, his
Consciousness is "not devoted" (*ananuruddha*)'[^ananuruddha] to anything (or is
"not engaged" with anything) as for example the *puthujjana*'s
Consciousness is when he experiences a pleasant feeling. On the
other hand it is "not in opposition" (*appaṭiviruddha*) to anything
either, as for example the *puthujjana*'s Consciousness is when he
experiences an unpleasant feeling. Therefore, with regard to the
footing that the Four Primary Modes get and with regard to those
concepts like long and short, large and small, auspicious and
inauspicious, he is neither devoted to them nor is in opposition
to them. They bear no *significance* whatever to him as they do
bear to the non-Arahat. Now, the Arahat's Consciousness being
neither devoted to anything nor in opposition to anything, it is
said to be ceased' (*niruddha*). 'Non-Indicative' Consciousness
(which is the Arahat's Consciousness) is therefore a
Consciousness that is said to be 'ceased' (*viññānassa nirodhena*).
When Consciousness is said to be ceased, the Four Primary
Modes are said to get no footing in existence. Further, Name-and-
Form is also then said to be ceased, and therefore all concepts are
also said to be ceased.

[^ananuruddha]: Majjhima Nikāya II and Saṃyutta Nikāya IV, Saḷāyatana Saṃyutta, Saḷa Vagga, Sutta No. 1.

*Viññāna nirodha* - cessation of Consciousness - is used to refer
to the cessation of Grasping Consciousness (in which case it
points to the Arahat's Consciousness, i.e. to
*anidassana vifīñāna* - 'non-indicative' Consciousness)
as well as to the cessation of the Arahat's Consciousness
which occurs when the Arahat's life ceases.

To the extent that the Arahat has Consciousness, to that
extent the Four Primary Modes get a footing, and there is the
presence of the concepts of long and short, etc. But these have
nothing whatever to do with Grasping; and as a result the Arahat's
Consciousness being neither devoted to them nor obstructed by
them, they bear no significance whatever. When the Arahat's
Consiousness ceases with the laying down of life the Four
Primary Modes get no footing whatsoever, and likewise the
concepts of long and short, large and small, auspicious and
inauspicious, and Name-and-Form cease without any remainder
whatsoever.

Therefore the answer to the question is: "The non-indicative
Consciousness, the without end;[^anantam] the all given up[^paham]- there it is
where earth, water, fire and air get no footing. There it is where
long and short, large and small, auspicious and inauspicious, and
Name-and-Form cease without remainder; with the ceasing of
Consciousness, these cease."

[^anantam]: Anantaṃ (without end) should probably be taken to mean "without aim" or "without objective".

[^paham]: Pahaṃ, as a shortened form of pajahaṃ so as to maintain the metre in the verse, and meaning "given up entire1y", fits in here very much better than pabhaṃ.

The Arahat's Consciousness does not take anything as an
object for holding (*anārammanamevetaṁ*). The holding or the
Grasping is over, and so the subject ('I') is over. The subject ('I')
being over, 'my world' (*loko*) is over, a 'world beyond' is over;
coming, going, birth, death are all over; Suffering is over. "For
him who clings there is agitation. For him who clings not there
is no agitation. Agitation not being, there is calm. Calm being,
there is no inclination. Inclination not being, there is no coming,
no going. Coming and going not being, there is no decease-and-birth.
Decease-and-birth not being, there is no 'here' nor 'yonder'
nor anything in between. This, indeed, is the end of
Suffering."[^endofsuffering] Clearly this refers to Arahatship. "For him who
clings not" means "for the Arahat."

[^endofsuffering]: Udāna, Pāṭaligāmiya Vagga, Sutta No. 4.

These passages from the *Udāna* just quoted are misconstrued to
refer to the *Nibbāna* element without residue only because
attempts are made to understand them *verbally*. If seeing and
understanding the Buddha's Teaching is only a matter of verbally
understanding the *Sutta*, then one can be an Arahat in next to no
time. The *Nibbāna* element without residue is also seen described
by meaningless words like 'Absolute', 'Unconditioned', and so on,
only because of a lack of understanding, which in turn is born of
the attempt to understand the Teaching verbally. Further, it is
sometimes thought that the *Nibbāna* element without residue is
some kind of metaphysical existence which has nothing to do
with the Five Groups, yet, that it is an eternal existence of some
sort or other. Such a view can arise owing to the presence of that
very subtle form of Grasping - "*Nibbāna* is mine, he conceives"
(*nibbānaṁ meti maññati*) - which the Buddha refers to in his
Discourse on The Fundamentals 0f All Things.[^fundamentals]

[^fundamentals]: Majjhima Nikāya 1.

## note: another four asterisk mark: hierarchy to be solved.

The Buddha Said: "All *determinations* are Impermanent, all
things are Not-self, all *determinations* are Suffering" (*sabbe
saṅkhārā aniccā, sabbe dhammā anattā, sabbe sankhārā dukkhā*).
The following question can arise here: whilst saying that all
*things* are Not-self, why did the Buddha say that all
*determinations* are impermanent and Suffering? In other words,
whilst saying that all things are Not-self, why did he say that *all
things upon which other things depend* are Impermanent and
Suffering? Why did he not *directly* say all *things* are
Impermanent and Suffering as he did with regard in the
characteristic of Not-self?

The answer is that there is a distinct purpose in his Teaching.
He does not say things seeking others' approval of them. Nor
does he set out to *explain* or *analyse* things. He has just one
intention underlying his Teaching. That is, purely and simply, to
lead the follower towards the extinction of Suffering. And this
extinction of Suffering is at one and the same time the extinction
of all notions of 'self' and of all thoughts of 'I' and 'mine'. The
purpose of the Teaching is not to save 'self' but to be saved *from*
'self'.

Thus the Buddha does not take one directly towards a thing's
impermanence. He takes one towards it in an indirect manner, and
that is more effective. He shows that a thing is impermanent by
showing that the things upon which that thing depends are
impermanent. Then, since the thing is impermanent, he shows
that it is Not-self.

It should therefore be clear that this triad - 'All *determinations*
are Impermanent, all things are Not-self, all *determinations* are
Suffering" - is not an exposition of things pure and simple. It
includes a definite *way* of teaching.

This fact is lost sight of, and then in a conceptual manner
various reasons are adduced for its particular form. The most
common of these reasons appears to be that in this triad the word
'thing' (*dhamma*), unlike the word '*determinations*' (*saṅkhāra*),
includes *Nibbāna* also. In other words it is often thought that the
reason for the Buddha saying "all *determinations* are Impermanent,
all things are Not-self" without saying "all things are '
Impermanent, all things are Not-self" is that he wanted *Nibbāna*
too to be included as something Not-self.

But this is a wrong notion, and it is arrived at in the
following manner:

To begin with, the word *saṅkhāra* is taken to mean
"*determined*". That is, it is taken to be the same as *saṅkhata*. This,
as we have seen, is wrong. *Sankhāra* means something which
*determines* some other thing, i.e., a *determination*, or a
*determinant* Now, *Nibbāna* has been described as the
Not-*Determined*, i.e., as *asaṅkhata*. On the face of this description of
*Nibbāna* it cannot be included in the word *saṅkhāra* which is now
wrongly taken to be the same as *saṅkhata*. Therefore a word
which embraces both *saṅkhata* and *asaṅkhata* has to be found. That
would be *dhamma* (thing). Since the Buddha wanted *Nibbāna* also
to be described as Not-self the word *dhamma* was used.

Such is the wrong argument through which this wrong
notion is arrived at.

But the *Nibbāna* element, with or without residue, has
*nothing whatever* to do with 'self' *or* Not-self. In *Nibbāna* there
is no deception of a 'self' whatever, which means that there is no
such 'self' *to be denied*. There is no necessity whatever for Not-
self. The question of Not-self arises only when the question of
'self' arises. *Nibbāna* is beyond both 'self' and Not-self. The
Arahat has no notion whatever of 'Self'. Hence the Arahat has no
occasion whatever to see anything as Not-self. Seeing things as
Not-self is only the *path* to Purity[^purity] (or to *Nibbāna*). It is *not*
Purity. "All things are Not-self. When this is seen with wisdom,
one wearies oneself of Suffering. This is the path to Purity."[]^path] The
Arahat *has arrived* at Purity and lives in Purity. He has come to
the end of 'Not, this is my self'.

[^purity]: Purity refers to Arahatship. See page 101.

[^path]: Dhammapada 279.

With the Five Grasping Groups there is a deception of a 'self'.
Something appears as 'self'. But this thing which appears as 'self'
is really not a self. That is to say, it is Not-self. The 'self' of the
Five Grasping Groups is *not* a self, since no self of any kind
whatever is to be found at all anywhere. Therefore this 'self' has
to be seen as Not-self.

With the residual Not-Grasping Groups of the Arahat there is
no apparent 'self' to be found. There *nothing* appears as 'self'.
Hence no seeing anything as Not-self arises.

Again: Though no self actually is to be found, things are
being seen as 'self' or Not-self. And seeing things as 'self'
precedes seeing things as Not-self. The Arahat has come to the
end of all seeings. And in *Nibbāna*, which is the experience of the
Arahat, there is no question of a seeing things as Not-Self, since
there is no question of a 'self' arising at all.

Perhaps an analogy would help to make this matter clearer.
Let us imagine two deer gazing at the sun shining upon the sand.
One of them is an ordinary deer, and being ordinary it sees 'water'
as it gazes at the said phenomenon. To this deer there is the
problem of 'water'. It has to be told that what it is taking for
'water' is not-water, and that it is merely the sun shining upon the
sand. Now let us imagine that the second deer has perfect
understanding and clear penetrative vision. To this deer, its vision
being so perfect, no 'water' appears at all. It also understands fully
well that it is gazing at the sun shining upon the sand. To this
deer there is nothing to be taken as 'water' or as not-water.
Suppose we now tell this clear visioned deer that the phenomenon
it is gazing at is not-water, it will look at us and say, "What on
earth are you speaking about?"

The confusion seems to lie in assuming that when the
Buddha says some *dhamma* is *anattā*, what the Buddha purely and
simply means by it is that *in* that *dhamma* there is no *attā*.
Such an assumption is a very grave lapse, seriously misleading,
and missing the vital point. (To indicate that there is no
permanent self-existent thing anywhere, a Buddha is not
necessary. A Hume would do for that. Let alone *in* the Arahat,
even *in* the *puthujjana* there is no actual self.) This type of
assumption will only lead us to the conclusion that, with regard
to the problem of 'self', there is really no difference between the
Arahat and the *puthujjana*. So that it will not lead us anywhere;
since the real culprit - that is, the *deception* of 'self' (which is
there for the *puthujjana*, but not there for the Arahat) - has been
beautifully allowed to escape notice, and so will continue to
remain as strong as it ever was. This is precisely what happens
with the individual who thinks that when the Buddha says some
*dhamma* is *anattā*, all that is meant by it is that *in* the *dhamma*
there is no *attā*. He further seeks confirmation of this verbal
understanding by analysing the Five Groups into infinitesimal
bits and pieces with the lofty equanimity of the scholar, and to
his great satisfaction (since his verbal understanding is being
confirmed) he sees no actual self anywhere. In fact he could well
spare himself the trouble of such fine analysis and yet see that
there is no self to be found anywhere. But - and that is the vital
point - in spite of all his masterly analysis, he still *looks upon
the Five Grasping Groups as 'self'*; more precisely, as 'my self'.

In this triad - *sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā, sabbe dhammā anattā,
sabbe sankhārā dukkhā* - the meaning of *sabbe dhammā anattā* is:
All things (which are taken as 'self') are Not-self. Thus it does not
apply to Arahatship or *Nibbāna*.

As we have said earlier the Buddha is teaching with a definite
purpose. He does not have to help us remove a self that actually
does not exist. He is helping us to remove the *notion* of 'self'
that exists with us. And he, and *only* he, can help us to remove
this notion. His Teaching is one that is designed to lead on
towards a specific goal. That is also why he says that the
*saṅkhārā* are *aniccā*, without directly saying that the dhamma
(which are *saṅkhatā*. and dependent on *saṅkhārā*) are *aniccā*.
Further, his Teaching is also one that is 'well said' (*svākhāto*).
But it is also necessary that we understand it well.[^voice]

[^voice]:
    Note the following statement of the Buddha:
    
    "Dependent on two things, monks, is there the arising of wrong view. What two? Voice from beyond, and improper attention. Dependent on these two things, monks, is there the arising of wrong view."
    
    "Dependent on two things, monks, is there the arising of right view. What two? Voice from beyond, and proper attention Dependent on these two things, monks, is there the arising of right view." (*Anguttara Nikāya I, Duka Nipāta, Āsā Vagga, Suttas No. 8 and 9*)
    
    'Voice from beyond' (*Parato ghoso*) refers to the voice of an Arahat, the 'beyond' referring to Arahatship. See page 97.

"What is impermanent, that is Suffering; what is Suffering,
that is Not-self" (*yad aniccaṁ taṁ dukkhaṁ, yaṁ dukkaṁ tad
anattā*).[^characteristics] Here again, the Buddha is showing the person who is
seeing things as 'self' how and why those things are Not-self.
Wherever a 'self' is asserted the Buddha rejects it, and shows that
there is no basis to consider anything as a self. He does not have
to do that with the Arahat. These three characteristics of
Impermanence, Not-self and Suffering always stand or fall
together. *Nibbāna*, with or without residue, is *beyond* all these
three characteristics.
