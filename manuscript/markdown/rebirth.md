# Rebirth

A discussion on rebirth is usually a discussion on a subject
concerning which there is no personal experience among those
who discuss it. Also, for the task of seeking a solution to the
*present* problem of Suffering in the *present* itself, a study of
rebirth is not essential. For these reasons this chapter will not be
a discussion on the subject of rebirth proper. Nevertheless there
are a couple of matters regarding rebirth which are worth of
thought. This chapter will therefore limit itself to a discussion of
those matters.

However much one may argue and infer that it is only
through the Buddha's doctrine of rebirth that the variegated
inequalities of human beings could be accounted for, there yet
remains a certain amount of doubt about it until one *sees* rebirth.
Until then, to some extent or other, one has trust in the Buddha
with regard to the matter.

On the other hand the Buddha demands no belief in rebirth
from one whose sole aim is to end Suffering, nor does he insist
that one must see rebirth if one is to come to the end of
Suffering. As we pointed out earlier, the *Suttas* speak of Arahats
who saw rebirth and could recollect past lives as well as of those
who could *not*.[^rebirth1] Certainly belief in rebirth would be very useful
in that it would act as an urge to reach the Path as fast and as
diligently as possible, and so get to *Ariyabhumi* (plane of the
*Ariyas*) at least, in this life. But it is not absolutely essential.[^not-essential]

[^rebirth1]: For example: Saṃyutta Nikāya II, Abhisamaya Saṃyutta, Mahā Vagga, Sutta No. 10, and Saṃyutta Nikāya II, Kassapa Saṃyutta, Sutta No. 9.

[^not-essential]:
    It is sometimes thought that the most effective way of convincing one of the validity of the Buddha's Teaching is to prove to one that there is rebirth. This is not so. We find that even ascetics who could see rebirth and could recollect their past lives did not always accept the Buddha's Teaching In fact, their very seeing rebirth and recollecting past lives made them come to wrong View. For example, see Dīgha Nikāya 1.
    
    Far too much time seems to be spent on the subject of rebirth by those interested in the Buddha's Teaching. If this time is spent by them in trying to see here and now itself a solution to the problem of their present existence, they are bound to be benefited much more, and in fact will also be attracted towards the Buddha's Teaching much more.

The present problem of my existence, which is just the
problem of my *present* Suffering, is to be solved *here* and *now*
with no reference to a past life or a future life. Whether there will
be or whether there will not be a renewed existence (*punabbhava*)
for the *puthujjana*, it is clear that for the Arahat there can be no
renewed existence in the future. The Arahat has already done away
with birth (*jāti*) and existence (*bhava*) here itself, these never to
arise again. Likewise, it is clear that for the *sekhas*, whatever
rebirth awaits them, it cannot be in spheres of unfortunate or
unpleasant experience, for the simple reason that the key factor
which conditions such experience is out in them - *sakkāyadiṭṭhi*,
and that thoughts of 'I' and 'mine' keep steadily declining in
them. *Tanhā*, desire, attachment - these factors which upbring all
the Suffering are thereby greatly reduced in the *Sekhas*, and hence
Suffering is greatly reduced. Whatever new existence awaits them
after death here, that will be an existence with a very reduced
degree of Suffering. Indicating the magnitude of the *sotāpanna*'s
achievement with a simile, the Buddha points out that the
Suffering the *sotāpanna* has destroyed is as vast as the earth
whilst the Suffering he will have to endure in the future during a
maximum of a further seven lives is as small as the bit of soil he
placed on his finger nail.[^fingernail] With regard to the relative value of the
*sotāpanna*'s achievement it is said: "Better than sole kingship of
the earth, better than going to heaven, better than supreme
rulership of all the worlds, is the fruit of Stream-entrance
(*Sotāpattiphalaṁ*)."[^fruit]

[^fingernail]: Saṃyutta Nikāya, II, Abhisamaya Saṃyutta, Abhisamaya Vagga, Sutta No. 1.
[^fruit]: Dhammapada 178.

There are many passages in the *Suttas*[^rebirth2] where we have the
Buddha teaching in a rather general manner how one is reborn in
accordance with one's deeds. That is, he teaches that the rebirth
awaiting a person is *in accordance with* his *kamma*.[^rebirth3]

[^rebirth2]: For examp1e, in Majjhima Nikāya 135.
[^rebirth3]: Majjhima Nikāya 136.

It should also be noted that the subject of rebirth need not
always remain a matter of trust in the Buddha. The Buddha has
shown the course by following which one could recollect his own
past lives and *see* other beings dying here and being born there
according to their deeds.[^rebirth4] To the individual who has achieved this
vision the subject of rebirth no longer remains a matter of trust in
the Buddha. To such an individual, rebirth is a matter of certainty.
The Buddha said that he himself could recollect the past as far
back as he wished.[^rebirth5]

[^rebirth4]: Majjhima Nikāya 77.
[^rebirth5]: Dīgha Nikāya 29.

On many an occasion the not yet enlightened monks went to
the Buddha, either for inspiration or from curiosity, and inquired
from him as to where some departed one had been reborn. As one
reads through these passages in the *Suttas*, one imagines the
Buddha smiling to himself at these questions and giving the
answers and the reasons for them, as one who answers children,
wishing to soothe them. In the *Mahāparinibbāna Sutta*[^mirror] we have
him telling Ananda who asked these questions: "Now there is
nothing strange in this, Ananda, that a human being should die;
but that as each one does you should come to me and inquire
about him in this manner - that is wearisome to me. I will,
therefore, preach to you a way of Dhamma called the Mirror of
Dhamma, which if the Ariyan disciple possesses, he may, if he
should so desire, himself predict to himself: Torment is destroyed
for me; so is the animal womb, the *peta* realm. Destroyed is the
falling into hells, into states of woe. I am *sotāpanna*, I am of the
nature not to fall away, and am assured of attaining the goal of
Enlightenment."

[^mirror]: Dīgha Nikāya 16.

From this statement of the Buddha it would also appear that
the *sotāpanna* (even though he may not actually *see* rebirth) has
some sort of self-assurance that whatever rebirth awaits him, it
will not be in an unfortunate sphere. It would not be idle
speculation to reflect on this important characteristic of the
*sotāpanna* and try to see whether any adequate reason lies for its
being so.

The Buddha says that the *sotāpanna* will not be reborn in the
animal world, the world of the *petas*, and such other unfortunate
worlds. Of these worlds the world best known to us is the animal
world. For this reason, we may limit our discussion to the beings
in this world, i.e., to the animals.

There is really no *fundamental* or *basic* difference between
the *puthujjana* and the animal in as much as both regard Form,
Feeling, Perception, *Determinations* and Consciousness as
'mine’. The *puthujjana* can however (though perhaps not in all
cases) *develop* himself so as to regard these as ’*not* mine', in
which case of course he no longer remains a *puthujjana*. This
development is not available to the animal, so that there can be
no animal which will be regarding its Form, Feeling, Perception,
*Determinations* and Consciousness as 'not mine'. The
fundamental attitude of the *puthujjana* and the animal being the
*same*, and the fundamental attitude as between the *sotāpanna* and
the animal being *opposite*, it would appear that whilst the
*puthujjana* can be reborn an animal the *sotāpanna* *cannot*. The
fundamental characteristic of the *sotāpanna*'s mentality being 'not
mine', he cannot be born in a realm where the mentality of each
and every being in it has the fundamental characteristic of
regarding things as 'mine'. The realms of the *petas*, etc, would
also appear to be those in which each and every being possesses
this latter mentality.

Viewed from the angle of rebirth it is rather frightening, and
it indicates that the *puthujjana* is in a perilously insecure
position. If he cannot develop himself to the extent of becoming
a *sotāpanna* he must at least try his best to understand
and practise the Buddha's Teaching.

One, however, comes across the individual who argues thus:
however much life may be Suffering, I will make the most of it
and die; for, why should I sacrifice all my sense-pleasures and
make so great an endeavour as to tread the Noble Eightfold Path if
I cannot get a certain proof that I shall be reborn when I die?

At first glance, this may appear a practical and sensible
argument. But such an individual is no destroyer of Suffering.
Leaving aside the fact that he does not actually *see* that life is
Suffering, he does not even see that he has a problem. In him one
discerns only a looking for reasons to support a way of life for
which he longs. And even if such a person be given a certain
proof of rebirth such as he may desire, it is a matter of grave
doubt whether he will choose to practise the Buddha's Teaching or
to merely do deeds that he thinks will ensure for him a more
fortunate life hereafter.

What can Buddhism do with such people? It can only wait for
them, patiently and with compassion, until some rude shock has
awakened them to the true characteristics of their existence, when
they may come to it as genuine thinkers.

Rebirth or no rebirth, each and every individual (save of
course the Arahat) is undergoing Suffering. But it is only a very
small proportion that can see even the unsatisfactory and
disquieting nature of existence. And it is only this small
proportion that has the potential to become genuine followers of
the Buddha.

In the final analysis, it all comes down to one's attitude
towards the problem of one's own existence. Do I have a *present*
problem which I must solve in the *present* itself, or do I not? If I
*do have* such a prob1em, then all discussions on past lives and
future lives can certainly wait.
