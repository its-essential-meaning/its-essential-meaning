# Saṅkhāra

It is now necessary to discuss the key-word *saṅkhāra*, examine how it
appears in the various contexts, and determine whether a meaning to
this word which will comfortably accommodate all its applications
could be derived.

Below are six important uses of this word found in the *Suttas*
(Discourses).

Firstly, it is the name given to the fourth Group
(*saṅkhāra-kkhandha*) which has been translated as the Group of
Determinations. This fourth Group is defined as *cetanā-kāya*, i.e.,
as intention-group. Thus, in the context of the fourth Group,
*saṅkhāra* is synonymous with intention (*cetanā*).

Secondly, in the context of the Doctrine of Dependent Arising
(*paṭiccasamuppāda*) where it occurs in *saṅkhārapaccayā viññānaṃ*, it
is defined as bodily-*saṅkhāra*, verbal-*saṅkhāra* and
mental-*saṅkhāra* thus: “What, monks, are the *saṅkhāra*? They are the
three *saṅkhāra*, namely, bodily-*saṅkhāra*, verbal-*saṅkhāra* and
mental-*saṅkhāra*.  These, monks, are called the *saṅkhāra*.”[^1]
These three kinds of *saṅkhāra* are in turn defined in the
*Cūlavedalla Sutta*[^2] as follows:

> “Friend, Visākha, in-breathing and out-breathing are the
> bodily-*saṅkhāra*. Discursive thinking is the verbal-*saṅkhāra*
> Perception and Feeling are the mental-*saṅkhāra*.”
>
> “Noble lady, for what reason are in-breathing and out- breathing the
> bodily-*saṅkhāra*? For what reason is discursive thinking the
> verbal-*saṅkhāra*? For what reason are Perception and Feeling the
> mental-*saṅkhāra*?”
>
> “Friend, Visākha, in-breathing and out-breathing are corporeal.
> These are closely connected with (*paṭibaddhā*) the body. Therefore
> they are bodily-*saṅkhāra*. Having earlier had discursive thinking,
> one subsequently utters words. Therefore discursive thinking is
> verbal-*saṅkhāra*. Perception and Feeling are mental. These are
> closely connected with the mind. Therefore they are
> mental-*saṅkhāra*.”

Thirdly, in the *Kukkuravatiya Sutta*,[^3] bodily-*saṅkhāra*,
verbal-*saṅkhāra* and mental-*saṅkhāra* appear in a somewhat different
context thus: “Here, Punna, someone determines a bodily-*saṅkhāra*
that is harmful, determines a verbal-*saṅkhāra* that is harmfu1,
determines a mental-*saṅkhāra* that is harmful. He having determined a
bodily-*saṅkhāra* … a verbal-*saṅkhāra* … a mental-*saṅkhāra* that is
harmful, upbrings a world that is harmful.”

Fourthly, in the context of the Doctrine of Dependent Arising, the
*Parivīmaṁsana Sutta*[^4] contains *saṅkhāra* as
meritorious-*saṅkhāra*, demeritorious-*saṅkhāra*, and
imperturbable-*saṅkhāra*, thus: “Were, monks, an ignorant individual
to determine a meritorious-*saṅkhāra* his consciousness would go
towards merit. Were he to determine a demeritorious-*saṅkhāra* his
consciousness would go towards demerit.  Were he to determine an
imperturbable-*saṅkhāra* his consciousness would go towards
imperturbability. A monk who has got rid of Ignorance and has attained
to Knowledge, monks, through such non-attachment to Ignorance and the
arising of Knowledge does not determine meritorious-*saṅkhāra*, does
not determine demeritorious-*saṅkhāra*, does not determine
imperturbable-*saṅkhāra*. Not determining, not intending, he grasps at
nothing in the world.”

Fifthly, the *Khajjaniya Sutta*[^5] identifies *saṅkhāra* as the
fourth Group thus.

> “Why, monks, do ye say *sahkhāra*? They determine (*abhisaṅkaronti*)
> the determined. That is why they are called *saṅkhāra*. What is the
> determined that they determine? Determined Form do they determine in
> accordance with the nature of Form. Determined Feeling do they
> determine in accordance with the nature of Feeling. Determined
> Perception do they determine in accordance with the nature of
> Perception. Determined Determinations do they detemine in
> accordance with the nature of Determinations. Determined
> Consciousness do they determine in accordance with the nature of
> Consciousness. They determine the determined. That is why they are
> called *saṅkhāra*.”

Sixthly, in the Mahāvedalla Sutta[^6] heat is called a
life-*saṅkhāra*, as that on which depends (*paṭicca*) life.

It might assist the reader to see the above mentioned relationships
better if they are presented in the following manner:

FIXME: add figure.

Thus, firstly, *saṅkhāra* is synonymous with intention as adopted in
the case of the fourth Group in the Five Groups. Secondly, in the
*Cūlavedalla Sutta* we cannot equate *saṅkhāra* entirely to
intention.  Thirdly, the three kinds of *saṅkhāra* mentioned in the
*Kukkuravatiya Sutta* appear in the said *Sutta* as varieties of
intentional action, and therefore have a lot to do with intention.
Fourthly, in the *Parivīmaṁsana Sutta*, *saṅkhāra* are again certainly
some kind of intention upon which the Consciousness of the ignorant
individual depends. Fifthly, in the *Khajjaniya Sutta*, *saṅkhāra*
(synonymous with intention) are described as things that determine the
Five Groups. And, Sixthly, in the *Mahāvedalla Sutta* life-*saṅkhāra*
is given as heat upon which depends life.

Now, the words *paṭibaddhā* in the *Cūlavedalla Sutta* passage,
*abhisaṅkaronti* in the *Khajjaniya Sutta* passage, and *paṭicca* in
the *Mahāvedalla Sutta* passage are most indicative of what the word
*saṅkhāra* means. It means a thing to which some other thing is
closely connected, or a thing upon which some other thing depends, or
a thing without which some other thing cannot be, or a thing which
determines some other thing. *Saṅkhāra*, therefore, in short means: a
determination, or *necessary condition*. This one meaning covers all
uses of this word.

What is meant by determination or *necessary condition* (that is to
say, *saṅkhāra*) must be distinctly understood. It means that whatever
thing depends upon this necessary condition, that thing can exist
*only if* this necessary condition is present. The thing cannot be
present without the necessary condition being present. If the
necessary condition is absent, then the thing is also absent. It
should not be understood as ‘once the necessary condition has come and
gone the thing arises’. Nor must it be understood as ‘the necessary
condition *becomes* the thing’. No.There is no *temporal* succession
one after the other. If the necessary condition is gone, then the
thing is also gone. This is a structural principle.

It should also be clearly understood that *saṅkhāra* do not refer to
the things (*dhammā*) for which they form necessary condition. The
things that are determined or upbuilt with the *saṅkhāra* as necessary
condition are called *saṅkhatā dhammā* (determined things). These
*saṅkhatā dhammā* are, however, *of the nature of saṅkhāra*. That is
to say, these determined things in turn act as the necessary condition
for other determined things. For example, the Six Bases are necessary
condition for Contact. This means that Contact cannot come about
without the presence of the Six Bases. ThuS, in this instance, the Six
Bases are *saṅkhāra* and Contact is a *saṅkhatā dhammā*. But again,
Contact which is on the one hand a *saṅkhatā dhammā* is the necessary
condition for something else, viz., Feeling. Without Contact, no
Feeling. Thus Contact as a *saṅkhatā dhammā* is also a *saṅkhāra*,
dependent upon which stands Feeling. The same applies to the Five
Grasping Groups. The Five Grasping Groups are *saṅkhatā dhammā* with
*saṅkhāra* (primarily, intention) as necessary condition. But they are
also the necessary condition for something else, viz., Grasping. Thus,
the Five Grasping Groups are both *saṅkhatā dhammā* and *saṅkhāra*.
That is what is meant by saying that all *saṅkhatā dhammā* are in the
nature of *saṅkhāra*.

These implications of the word *saṅkhāra*, have to be clearly
understood. Quite a lot of the fanciful interpretations of the
Buddha-word are due to not understanding the precise meaning of the
word *saṅkhāra* and the manner in which it is used in the *Suttas*.
