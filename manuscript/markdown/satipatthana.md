# A Note on the Four Applications of Mindfulness
## (*Cattāro Satipaṭṭhānā*)

The actual way of living out the Noble Eightfold Path for the
development of Wisdom and therewith gaining deliverance from
Suffering, or for attaining Arahatship, is the practising of the
Fourfold Applications of Mindfulness (*cattāro satipaṭṭhānā*). How
one practises this Way of Mindfulness is given in the Discourse
called the *Mahā Satipaṭṭhānā Sutta*.

It is sometimes thought that the practice of this Way of
Mindfulness can be undertaken without any prior understanding
of the Buddha’s Teaching. This is wrong. To the one who
examines the Satipaṭṭhānā Sutta carefully it is quite clear that there
must be a good understanding of the Teaching if one is to
embark on the practice of the four *satipaṭṭhānas* so to obtain any
beneficial results. Repeatedly the *Satipaṭṭhānā Sutta* says "abides
seeing the nature of things in things" (*dhammesu dhammānupassī
viharati*)[^sati], and this abiding is defined as understanding or knowing
as it really is (*yathābhūtaṁ pajānāti*), This means that the
individual practising it is one who is *seeing*.

[^sati]: Dīgha Nikaya 22. Also, Majjhima Nikāya 10.

#### __this footnote actually has no numbered reference in the text, but it is presumably referring to either to the chapter title or, more probably, to 'dhammesu dhammanupassi viharati'__

Further, the *Sutta* says that if the *Satipaṭṭhānā* is practised for
between seven years to seven days the individual so practising it
can expect either Arahatship or *anāgāmi*-ship. This therefore
indicates that, if such great results are to be expected, its practice
has to be a full-time pursuit which cannot in any way be taken
lightly. For instance, *kamesu micchācārā vāyāmo* will not be a
mere avoidance of "wrongful" sex conduct as it is sometimes
supposed to be, but a *complete cutting away* from *all* pleasures
of the senses. Such a thorough practice is very difficult for a
householder. Therefore it would be incorrect to expect one to
become a *sotāpanna*, *sakadāgāmi* or *anāgāmi*, or even to reach the
Path, by a repetition of the *Satipaṭṭhānā Sutta* however often and
regularly that be.

It is also sometimes thought that the fruits mentioned in the
*Satipaṭṭhānā Sutta* can be achieved quickly and in a comfortable
manner without sufficient renunciation. Such individuals sooner
or later find themselves disillusioned. And then the worst of it all
happens. Having been so diSillusioned, they begin to wonder
whether the Buddha has been right or wrong; and to add to the
bargain they imagine that they are now in a better position to
wonder.

The Buddha says that the *Satipaṭṭhānā* is the "one and only
way” (*ekāyano maggo*) to the full comprehension of the Four
Noble Truths and therefore to Arahatship. In order to see this one
should examine in detail what is meant by "abides seeing the
nature of things in things” (*dhammesu dhammānupassī
viharati*).

*Viharati* means abides or lives. That means one is having
living experience. In other words one is *conscious* of something
Categorizing broadly, one is conscious of the four Groups of
Form, Feeling, Perception and *Determinations*. That any of these
Four Groups is *present* means one is conscious of it.

Consciousness is *always* entailed. That is why Consciousness is
not one of the four *satipaṭṭhāna* - the four *satipaṭṭhānas* being on
the Body (i.e. the most important Form to one), Feeling,
Mentality (*citta*) and dhammas (*things*). Not doubt Consciousness
is included in the list of the *dhammas* which are to be
contemplated on under the fourth *satipaṭṭhāna* called *dhammesu dhammānupassī
viharati*. But that is different.

Now, all living experience can be classified under two
categories:

1. Experiencing something and having *right* knowledge
about the experience,

2. Experiencing something and having *wrong* knowledge
about the experience.

I can see a rope and recognize it as a rope, or I can see a rope
and take it for a snake. Whilst seeing the sun shining upon the
sand I can take it to be 'water' or to be the sun shining upon the
sand. The seeing, together with the wrong understanding, is as
much a living experience as the seeing together with the right
understanding is. Likewise one experiences a certain thing. One
feels a feeling (*vedanaṁ vediyāmī*). That is, there is *vedanāsu* ... *viharati*.
One experiences a lustful thought (*sarāgaṁ cittaṁ*).
That is, there is *citte* ... *viharati*. Likewise there is the
experience of the various *dhammas* That is, there is *dhammesu* ... *viharati*.
But - and this is the important thing - one can see the
true nature of that which is being experienced *or* not see it.
Seeing the true nature of the feeling that is being experienced is
the *vedanānupassī*. Likewise, seeing the true nature of the thought
is the *cittānupassī*. Seeing the true nature of the *dhamma* is the
*dhammānupassī*. So, together we get *vedanāsu vedanānupassī
viharati*, *citte cittānupassī viharati* and *dhammesu dhammānupassi viharati*.

The position with regard to the *satipaṭṭhāna* on the body is
slightly different towards the latter part, in that one does not and
cannot experience in oneself all the states of the body described
therein, such as the dead body in the charnel-field, though of
course one sees that the same fate will befall one's own body. In
this particular case one sees the phenomenon externally (i.e. as of
another) but as applicable internally (i.e. to oneself) too. A matter
worthy of note in this *satipaṭṭhāna* concerning the body is the use
of the word *kāyasankhāra*. Having spoken of the in-breathing and
out-breathing, the word *kāyasaṅkhāra* is brought in. *Kāyasankhāra*,
we have seen, has been defined as in-breathing and out-breathing.
Diverting the mind to *kāyasaṅkhāra* is to indicate that the
in-breathing and out-breathing is the *saṅkhāra* upon which the body
stands supported When the thing (body, in this case) is seen to
depend on a *saṅkhāra* (breathing, in this case) that is subject to
arising and passing away, then it is seen that the thing (body) is
also subject to arising and passing away, and is therefore Not-self.
Therefore to translate *kāyasankhāra* as "activity of the body” or as
"bodily formation” is not only wrong but also misleading and
misses the entire purpose.

It is quite clear that there can be *no other way* for one to
fully comprehend things. The *dhammesu* ... *viharati* part is
necessary for *full* comprehension, since full comprehension
comes only with actual experience. That is why, though the
*sekha* sees the cessation of Suffering, he is described as not
having fully comprehended it. To fully comprehend it or
*penetratively* see it *through and through* he must also *experience*
it. The Arahat is at all times experiencing the cessation of
Suffering. He therefore fully comprehends it and sees it
penetratively through and through.

The *Satipatthānā Sutta* assumes a prior understanding of the
Buddha's Teaching. Obviously, this understanding cannot be
obtained from this *Sutta*. It has to be obtained from the other
*Suttas*. Therefore, before embarking on the actual practice of the
*Satipatthāna* one has to go through the other *Suttas* and devote a
great deal of time to trying to obtain sufficient understanding of
the Buddha's Teaching. And the most certain way of obtaining a
proper understanding of it is to build one's understanding on the
very fundamentals that the Buddha has taught in the *Mūlapariyāya
Sutta*. But very hard work is needed. In conclusion one can only
repeat what has already been said in the preface - that is, that
though these fundamentals and their resultant implications are
very difficult to *see*, they edify him who sees them. They are
truth *for him*.
