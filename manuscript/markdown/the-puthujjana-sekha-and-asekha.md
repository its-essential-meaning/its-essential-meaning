# The Puthujjana, Sekha and Asekha

There are three distinct classes of individuals that the Buddha's
Teaching brings out, i.e. the *puthujjana*, the *sekha* (Learner), and
the *asekha* (Learning-ender). The fundamental differences between
them are as follows:

1. The *puthujjana* regards things as 'mine'.
2. The *sekha* (learner) knows and sees that the notion 'mine' is wrong but the
   notion 'mine' still arises in him. Therefore he regards things as 'not mine'.
3. The *asekha* (Learning-ender) not only knows and sees fully that the notion
   'mine' is wrong, but also no thoughts of 'mine' whatsoever arise in him. Thus
   he neither regards things as 'mine' nor as 'not mine'. The *asekha* is the
   Arahat.

From these fundamental differences follow all other differences that lie between
them. We can therefore indicate the differences between them in other ways too.
As an example, we may speak of their differences as follows; the *puthujjana*
does not see the Buddha's Teaching; the *sekha* sees the Buddha's Teaching but
has not fully experienced it; the *asekha* not only sees the Buddha's Teaching
but also *fully* experiences it.

To the extent the *sekha* experiences the Teaching, to that extent does he see
the Teaching better. His seeing is still imperfect and his cultivation of the
Four Applications of Mindfulness[^four] is only partial (*catunnaṃ kho āvuso
satipaṭṭhānānaṃ padesaṃ bhāvitattā*)[^catunnam] as against that of the *asekha*
which is complete (*satipaṭṭhānānaṃ samattaṃ bhāvitattā*).[^satip] He, the
*sekha*, can see a part of the Teaching without experiencing it. But seeing and
understanding in the *fullest* sense comes only with the experience of it. It is
therefore to be expected that there would be various classes of *sekhas*
depending on the extent to which they experience the Teaching.

[^four]: On the Four Applications of Mindfulness see Ch. XVII.

[^catunnam]: Saṃyutta Nikāya V, Satipaṭṭhana Saṃyutta, Sīlaṭṭhiti Vagga, Sutta No. 6.

[^satip]: Saṃyutta Nikāya V, Satipaṭṭhana Saṃyutta, Sīlaṭṭhiti Vagga, Sutta No. 7.

In the *Saṁyutta Nikāya V* we have the difference between the
*sekha* and the *asekha* denoted as follows:

"Again, monks, the monk who is a *sekha* knows the five
controlling faculties: faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration,
and wisdom. Yet he neither lives experiencing with the body, nor
penetratively sees with wisdom, what they lead to, their
excellence, their fruit, and their end ... Here, monks, a monk
who is an *asekha* knows the five controlling faculties: faith,
energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. He lives
experiencing with the body, penetratively seeing with wisdom,
what they lead to, their excellence, their fruit, and their end."[^difference]

[^difference]: Saṃyutta Nikāya V, Indriya Saṃyutta, Chaṭṭho Vagga, Sutta No. 3.

The *sekha* has faith in the fact that deathlessness can be
attained by developing the five controlling faculties. He "stands
knocking at the door of deathlessness" - *amara dvāraṁ āhacca
tiṭṭhati.*[^knocking] But the *asekha* having developed these faculties fully
has achieved deathlessness and lives experiencing deathlessness.
Arahat Sāriputta said that the latter was the case with him.
Incidentally, it is wrong to think that the *puthujjana* has these
faculties. The *puthujjana* does not possess these faculties. It is the
*sekha* who has acquired them, but of course he has to develop
them.[^develop]

[^knocking]: Saṃyutta Nikāya II, Abhisamaya Saṃyutta, Gahapati Vagga, Sutta No. 9.

[^develop]: Saṃyutta Nikāya V, Indriya Saṃyutta, Mudatara Vagga, Suttas No. 12 and 8.

Khemaka, an *Anāgami* (i.e. one of the higher classes of
*sekhas*) says: "Though, friends, I discern in the Five Grasping
Groups no self nor aught pertaining to se1f, yet I am not Arahat,
nor one in whom the cankers are destroyed. Though, friend, in the
Five Grasping groups is found 'I am', yet I do not discern that I
am this 'I am'.” Further, "Friends, though an Ariyan disciple has
put away the five lower fetters, yet there remains in his Five
Grasping Groups the conceit 'I am', the desire 'I am', the tendency
’I am', still not removed from him."[^Khemaka]

[^Khemaka]: Saṃyutta Nikāya III, Khandha Saṃyutta, Thera Vagga, Sutta No. 7.

The *puthujjana* is *not* on the Path to *Nibbāna*, whilst the
*sekha* is on the Path. And once an individual is on the Path, the
Buddha teaches that he is assured of arriving at *Nibbāna*. The
*sekha* is assured of being an *asekha* (i.e. Arahat). The *asekha* or
the Arahat *has trod the Path to completion* and has arrived at the
goal of *Nibbāna*. He lives experiencing *Nibbāna*.

Now, all *sekhas* and the *asekhas* are referred to as *Ariyas*.
Thus, in the broadest classification we have *puthujjanas* and
*Ariyas*. Literally, *Ariya* means Noble.

We may now examine in some detail the various categories
of individuals classed as *puthujjanas* and *Ariyas*.

Two classes of *puthujjanas* can be distinguished:

1. The *assutavā* (one who has not heard). He has not heard
the Buddha's Teaching, and so he holds views contrary to the
Teaching.

2. The *anulomikāya khantiyā samannāgata* (one possessed
of acquiescence in agreement). He has heard the Teaching, and he
possesses tacit agreement with the Teaching. But he is not one
who has merely studied the Teaching and or professes to follow
the Teaching. He is much more than that. He makes a genuine
attempt to realize the Teaching in himself, knowing that he still
does not actually see the Teaching.[^agreement]

[^agreement]: Saṃyutta Nikāya III, Chakka Nipāta, Ānisamsa Vagga.

Of these two kinds of *puthujjana* the *assutavā* is me kind
that is to be found more often.

There are eight classes of *Ariyas*. In ascending order of
perfection they are:

1. *Sotāpattiphalasacchikiriyāya paṭipanno* - The one who
practices for the realization of the fruit of Steam-entrance.

2. *Sotāpanno* - The Stream-entrant.

3. *Sakadāgāmiphalasacchikiriyāya paṭipanno* - The one who
practises for the realization of the fruit of once-return.

4. *Sakadāgāmi* - The Once-returner.

5. *Anāgāmiphalasacchikiriyāya paṭipanno* - The one who
practises for the realization of the fruit of non-return.

6. *Anāgāmi* - The Non-returner.

7. *Arahattāya paṭipanno* - The one who practises for the
realization of Arahatship.

8. *Arahā* - The Arahat, or the Consummate One.

Of these eight, the first seven are not yet Arahat. That is,
they are still not Consummate or Perfect, and have still more
work to do. Thus they are called *sekhas* (Learners). But they are
all on the Path, and are assured of becoming Arahats or
Consummate Ones. They have crossed from the plane of the
*puthujjana* (*puthujjana-bhūmi*) to the plane of the Noble
(*ariya-bhūmi*). The last and the eighth, i.e. the Arahat, has done
whatever was to be done, has finished training, has achieved the
goal, has laid down the burden, has attained the Consummate
state, has attained *Nibbāna*. He is therefore *asekha*
(Learning-ender).

Thus, with the *puthujjana*, we have nine kinds of
individuals.[^ninekinds] If we take into account the two types of *puthujjanas*
we then have ten kinds of individuals.

[^ninekinds]: Anguttara Nikāya IV, Navaka Nipāta, Sambodhi Vagga, Sutta No. 9.

It will be seen that of the seven *sekhas* there are fruit-attainers
(*phala-lābhi*), i.e. the *sotāpanna*, the *sakadāgāmi* and the *anāgāmi*.
The remaining four are practising for the realization of the
corresponding fruit. Thus they are called path-attainers (*magga-lābhi*).
They have attained to the path which will lead them to the
corresponding fruit. The *asekha* is also a fruit-attainer. He has
attained to the fruit of Arahatship. The notion that the attainment
of the fruit is immediately followed by the attainment of the path
is wrong. This notion found in certain Commentaries is not in
keeping with the *Suttas* wherein the path-attainer is definitely said
to be practising for the realization of the fruit. There is therefore a
time interval between path-attainment and fruit-attainment. "Here,
friends, a monk develops insight preceded by serenity. In thus
developing insight preceded by serenity, the Path is born. He
pursues that Path, develops and practises it. In him thus
pursuing, developing, and practising that Path, the fetters are put
away, and the latencies cease.“[^magga] However, the first class of
Path-attainer *shall always* attain the fruit before his death even if that
fruit-attainment be just before death. According to the *Suttas* one
of two thing makes this fruit attainment possible - diligent work,
or the crisis of approaching death which provide the necessary
impetus to attainment.[^fruit] Unlike the *puthujjana* who is subject to
retrogression the *sekha* whether he be a path-attainer or a
fruit-attainer progresses towards the goal.

[^magga]: Anguttara Nikāya II, Catukka Nipāta, Paṭipadā Vagga.

[^fruit]: Saṃyutta Nikāya III, Okkantika Saṃyutta, Sutta No. 1.

The Buddha teaches that there are ten fetters which bind
beings to *bhava*, and the *sekhas* who are fruit-attainers are
generally described in terms of the various fetters they have
broken. These fetters are (1) 'person'-view (*sakkāyadiṭṭhi*), (2)
Doubt (*vicikicchā*), (3) Practice of rites and ritual
(*sīlabbata-parāmāso*), (4) Desire for sense-pleasure (*kāmacchando*),
(5) Ill-will (*vyāpāda*), (6) Attachment to Form (*rūparāgo*), (7)
Attachment to no-Form (*arūparāgo*), (8) Conceit (*māno*), (9)
Restlessness (*uddhaccaṁ*), and (10) Ignorance (*avijjāṁ*). The first
five are described as lower fetters (*orambhāgiyāni saññojanāni*)
whilst the other five are described as higher fetters
(*uddhambhāgiyāni saññojanāni*).[^tenfetters]

[^tenfetters]: Anguttara Nikāya V, Dasala Nipāta. Nātha Vagga, Sutta No. 3.

The first fruit-attainer is called *sotāpanno* (Stream-entrant).
He has destroyed the first three fetters of 'person'-view, doubt, and
practice of rites and ritual. Entered the Stream (i.e. entered the
*sota*) means got on to the Noble Eightfold Path, the Stream (*sota*)
being defined as this path: "The Stream, Sāriputta, is just this
Noble Eightfold Path, that is to Say, right understanding, right
thinking, right action, right speech, right living, right effort,
right mindfulneSS, right concentration."[^stream] The second fruit-attainer
is called *sakadāgāmi* (Once-returner). He has destroyed the first
three fetters and reduced lust, hatred and delusion (*tiṇṇaṁ
saññojanānaṁ parikkhayā rāgadosamohānam tanutta*); Therefore
he has not only destroyed the first three fetters but also has partly
overcome the fourth and the fifth fetters, namely desire for sense-pleasure
and ill-will. The third fruit-attainer is called *anāgāmi*
(Non-returner). He has destroyed the first five fetters, i.e., the
lower fetters. The fourth and last fruit-attainer is of course the
Arahat who has destroyed all the ten fetters.

[^stream]: Saṃyutta Nikāya V, Sotāpati Saṃyutta, Veludrārra Vagga, Sutta No. 5.

The first path-attainers, i.e., those practising for the
realization of the fruit of Stream-entrance, are of two kinds - the
*dhammānusāri* (Dhamma-striver) and the *saddhānusāri*
(Faith-striver). These two have just crossed over from the plane of the
*puthujjana* to the plane of the *Ariya*. The *dhammānusāri* is one
who through wisdom is pleased with the Dhamma to an extent,
whilst the *saddhānusāri* is one who through faith is firmly
attached to Dhamma.[^striver] As stated earlier they are both incapable of
passing away without realizing the fruit of Stream-entrance, i.e.,
without becoming *sotāpanna*.

[^striver]: Majjhima Nikāya 70 and Saṃyutta Nikāya III, Okkantika Saṃyutta, Sutta No. 1.

The maximum number of lives left for the *sotāpanna* is seven
(*sattakkhattuṁ paramatā*). Further, none of these seven lives will
be in an unfortunate sphere. He is assured of *Nibbāna* or
Enlightenment within this period (niyato sambodhi-parāyano).
The *sakadāgāmi* returns once more to this world and
accomplishes the destruction of Suffering (*sakideva imaṁ lokaṁ
āgantvā dukkhassantaṁ karoti*). The *anāgāmi*, when he dies here,
will be reborn spontaneously in the Pure Abodes and attains to
Extinction there.[^attainment]

[^attainment]: Anguttara Nikāya 1, Tika Nipāta, Samana Vagga, Sutttas N0. 7 and 8.

All this means that, as a cart pushed just over the hilltop will
roll down by its own weight without extra effort, so will the
*sotāpanna* in any case end up in *Nibbāna* within a maximum of
seven further lives. The Buddha however exhorts all *sekhas* to act
with diligence (*appamādena karaṇīyan*) and try to make an end of
it all in this life itself by attaining Arahatship. "MonkSs, just as a
little bit of feces is foul smelling, even so do I not praise *bhava*,
not even for so brief a time as is needed for a finger snap."[^snap]
